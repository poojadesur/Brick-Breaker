 #### How to Run
 * run python3 main.py
 
#### How to Play
 * use a and d keyboard keys to move left and right respectively
 * use e to launch the ball from the paddle
 
#### OOPS Concepts 
 
 * Inheritance - my Object() Class is the super class that other objects in the gain are created as sub classes (child classes) such as Paddle(), Ball()
 * Polymorphism - The subclasses of the Object() class such as Paddle(), Ball(), Brick() include functions that override the same function, such as clear() and render()
 * Encapsulation - the paddle and balls are all instances (objects) of classes and are used throughout the code as global variables
 * Abstraction - functionality such as move() in the main function to take the input, ballMove() in the Ball class, removeBrick() in Brick() class are used throughout the code hiding away inner details from
the end user.
